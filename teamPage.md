## Team Lead: Kim Lim
Hello World! I'm Kim, a fourth-year Computer Science major with a great passion for software and web development. My interest in this field has grown immensely since diving into courses like Web Client Languages and Software Engineering. I thrive in both front-end and back-end development, and I'm particularly excited about the opportunities that API implementation and version control offer. I am proficient in both Java and Python languages and I use industry-standard tools like VSCode, and GitHub to deliver top-notch solutions. My expertise extends to Agile methodologies, project management, object-oriented programming, debugging, and database management. In addition to my technical skills, I excel in collaborative settings, demonstrating exceptional leadership abilities and effective communication across diverse, cross-functional teams. I'm thrilled about the challenges and learning opportunities that lie ahead in this quarter and beyond!

## Team Lead: Adhithi Ganesan
Hi! Iâ€™m a 4th year Cognitive Science: Design and Interaction major/Computer Science minor. I love applying design principles to technical projects to create well designed and useful products. Iâ€™m interested in design, frontend development, and product management, and this project allowed me to explore all of these interests which I immensely appreciated. In my free time I like to hang out with my cat and friends, take Crossfit classes/ train for my half marathon, and read (currently reading A Woman Destroyed by Simone de Beauvoir).

## Cecilia Truong
Hello! Iâ€™m a 3rd year Math-CS major who likes to dabble in coding ðŸ¤¥ I like taking on fullstack roles since I work best in environments that let me try on different hats. For this project, Iâ€™ve primarily worked as a frontend developer. In my free time, I like to find new music, collect records, and go to concerts!

## Raul Martinez Beltran
Hello! Iâ€™m a 4th year Computer Science student with a cognitive science minor. Iâ€™m fascinated by software development and the processes behind planning and executing. Previously, I had worked on frontend on other projects and wanted to give the backend a shot. This project allowed me to develop my skills on backend development as well as integrating API calls with the frontend, which was definitely a learning experience for me. In my free time, I like to lift weights.

## Ethan Baruh
Hi, Iâ€™m a 4th year Computer Science major in Marshall College. Iâ€™m most interested in low level software development such as kernel and OS work. This project was my first time working on a large scale web application and using FastAPI so I was really excited to learn more web backend. In my free time I do a lot of rock climbing and skiing in the winter.
