# Team 3 Week 8 Workplan

## Sprint Priorities

 - create front end and back end for discover and recipe pages
 - discover page would embed tik tok cooking videos so people can discover new recipes
 - recipe page would have little cards with different recipes, can link to foods posted in Home Page so people can then find the recipe for that food on our site

## Meetings 
### Monday (5/20): Sprint Planning Meeting ###
- created issues on Github and assigned important tasks to all team members
- frontend team needs 1-2 days more to finish up tasks from last week so we'll be finishing those up, submitting PRs, and then assigning tasks after that (either working on discover page or recipes page)
- backend team is working on updating/deleting user, and backend for discover and recipes page
- decided to maybe use a free recipe DB API so we don't have to create our own recipes
