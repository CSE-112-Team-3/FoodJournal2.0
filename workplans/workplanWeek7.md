# Team 3 Week 7 Workplan

## Sprint Priorities

 - implement frontend and backend Home page which contains placards with food review information
- fix Sign Up Page (moving text entry labels above text boxes), making UI intuitive by playing UI golf (minimizing # of clicks)
- integrating API calls for frontend pages created last sprint

## Meetings 
### Tuesday (5/14): Sprint Planning Meeting ###
- created issues on Github and assigned important tasks to all team members
- not as urgent, but upcoming tasks were given "could" label so people who have extra time could choose to work on these tasks
- decided to focus on website development this sprint rather than social media aspect of website (creating users, creating posts under that account, etc.)
- talked about branch labeling (decided to create branch from issue page which conveniently names branch with issue # and name)
- decided pull request conventions
